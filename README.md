Every year there are thousands of movies released in many
different genres. Thus, there is a vast amount of movie data available on the
internet. IMDb is the most popular website that maintains movie dataset. In this
project I have build a MySQL database using the Internet Movie Database
(IMDb) dataset. The dataset consists of 7 compressed tab-separated-value
(*.tsv) files that can be downloaded from the IMDb website.
